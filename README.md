# WoW The Burning Crusade Classic Simulator

Welcome to the WoW The Burning Crusade Classic simulator! If you have questions or are thinking about contributing, [join our discord](https://discord.gg/jJMPr9JWwx) to chat!

The primary goal of this project is to provide a framework that makes it easy to build a DPS sim for any class/spec, with a polished UI and accurate results. Each community will have ownership / responsibility over their portion of the sim, to ensure accuracy and that their community is represented.

## Downloading Sim

Links for latest Sim build:

- [Windows Sim](https://github.com/wowsims/tbc-new/releases/latest/download/wowsimtbc-windows.exe.zip)
- [MacOS Sim](https://github.com/wowsims/tbc-new/releases/latest/download/wowsimtbc-amd64-darwin.zip)
- [Linux Sim](https://github.com/wowsims/tbc-new/releases/latest/download/wowsimtbc-amd64-linux.zip)

Then unzip the downloaded file, then open the unzipped file to open the sim in your browser!

Alternatively, you can choose from a specific relase on the [Releases](https://github.com/wowsims/tbc-new/releases) page and click the suitable link under "Assets"

## Desktop App

There is also an installable desktop version. It runs the sim in its own window instead of a
browser tab, shuts the sim server down when you close the window, and prompts you when a new
version is available. Grab the `.exe` (Windows) or `.dmg` (macOS) installer from the
[Releases](https://github.com/wowsims/tbc-new/releases) page.

Like the downloadable binary above, it sims on all your CPU cores rather than in WebAssembly
in the browser, so it is considerably faster than the website.

Note that the desktop app keeps its saved settings separately from your browser — to carry
existing setups across, use the sim's JSON export in the browser and import it in the app.

See [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md) for how it is built.
